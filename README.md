This Materials Lab was a class project that involved choosing a material to test, creating the experiment, testing, and providing results through a report and presentation.

We investigated the corrosive effects of Sulfuric Acid and Saline solution against 316 stainless steel and 1018 carbon steel. Results indicated how materials selection is an important factor when considering materials used in corrosive environments.
